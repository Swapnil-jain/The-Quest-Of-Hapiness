THE QUEST OF HAPPINESS is a single player 2D Platformer game. 
Using Unity and various other tools, I have tried to replicate the game Mario, with newer technologies and better graphics, and renamed my version as "The Quest of Happiness"
The game has the adventures of a hero, who is on search for happiness.  It have 3 levels, at the end of which, he is successfully able to achieve happiness. 
There are enemies in each level and a certain number of coins to be collected, to successfully reach the next level.

## How the game was made ?

### 2.1 Assets and Background
Using Blender and Photoshop, majority of assets were made. Choosing a basic layer color, followed by using color charts, a background with suitable theme fit for the level.
For the assets, 3D tools were used to build assets like rocks and trees. They are constructed by using various 3D modelling techniques like creating shapes using cubes or spheres as the basic unit.
Some of the assets/images are taken directly from Unity Asset Store or the web.

### 2.2 Sound
Team used Audacity and Ableton to create various sound effects for the game, suited for each level. Certain sound effects prebuilt into respective software are added on top of each other, and that is how new music is created.
For some of the sound effects, direct credit-free music was used from the internet. For game themes/music, the team used an online DAW (a software used to make music) namely BANDLAB.

### 2.3 Level Designing
Level designing was done independently by four different members of the team. Each one was in-charge of the design of a different theme in the game. Although the levels themselves largely vary from each other in terms of aesthetics, the process of construction followed a similar pattern. A base for the level was built on Unity Editor, on top of which the frame was constructed.

### 2.4 Coding
The entire project has been coded in C#, which is the standard programming language of Unity. Various libraries like A* pathfinding project have been used as well. For each and every action in the game, from pressing spacebar to attack, playing a sound when enemy dies, to loading the next level when player meets a certain condition, has been done using functions in unity. Every action calls a particular function, which then further decides the course of action.

### 2.5 Animations
The built-in animator component of Unity was used. Using a bunch of closely resembling images, an animation is created. The animator component is then used to add logic to the animation, to define whether to loop or animation, or the function which will trigger the animation when a certain condition is met.

### 2.6 Final Compilation
The final step was the addition background, props, effects, and music. This is followed by introduction of the character into the level, along with all the animations and coding. This also includes the creation of start page, pause menu and final credits scene. The logo of the game, the publisher, and the compatibility settings are then set up, and the first beta build is released.
After the feedback from the beta testers, the game was improved upon accordingly, and the final game was released.
