THE QUEST OF HAPPINESS is a single player 2D Platformer game. 
Using Unity and various other tools, I have tried to replicate the game Mario, with newer technologies and better graphics, and renamed my version as "The Quest of Happiness"
The game has the adventures of a hero, who is on search for happiness.  It have 3 levels, at the end of which, he is successfully able to achieve happiness. 
There are enemies in each level a and a certain number of coins to be collected, to successfully reach the next level.

## How the game was made ?

### 2.1 Assets and Background
Using Blender and Photoshop, the team went step by step in creating the required backgrounds and assets. Choosing a basic layer color, followed by using color charts, the team created a background with suitable theme fit for the level.
For the assets, 3D tools were used to build assets like rocks and trees. They are constructed by using various 3D modelling techniques like creating shapes using cubes or spheres as the basic unit.
